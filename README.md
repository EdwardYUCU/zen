### A tool to reveal word count and location of a file.

This is the Rust adaption of a program in *Fluent Python*. The original Python code is in chapter 3.

I name this program **zen** since the original Python code was runned on *The Zen of Python* as an example.

The **zen.txt** is written by Tim Peters and is copied from Python console by entering *import this*.
